KYC2020 LLC

KYC2020 was founded in 2016 to meet the sanction screening requirements of Small & Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs) and Emerging Payments FinTech that lacked viable and affordable solutions. A review of available market solutions exposed a significant deficiency: AML/CFT compliance systems were either too expensive, too disruptive to transaction flow or simply excessive for the purpose of a SME. The problem was that compliance systems had traditionally been aimed at financial institutional that have a larger burden of compliance. The emergence of KYC2020 as a stand-alone product/service was driven by the compliance needs of many online Money Services Businesses (MSBs) and grew from there.

We are looking for people with :

- Experience developing back-end APIs to power consumer product and/or SaaS platforms

- Experience with Node.js, SQL Databases, and React (or another framework like Ember or Angular)

- Desire to use and contribute back to open-source

- A drive to work in a fast-paced, team oriented environment
